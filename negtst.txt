"Stalked" is yet another forgettable addition to the tired genre of spurned-psychos-getting-their-revenge movies that plagued the 1990s film industry. This film follows the predictable formula of a mentally unstable man obsessing over a woman, with the only twist being that he's rejected rather quickly, deviating slightly from the norm of the psycho typically being an ex-lover.

From the opening credits, it's painfully obvious who the stalker is, leaving no room for suspense or intrigue. The contrived plot brings together the stalker, Daryl, and the victim, Brooke, in a series of predictable and cliché-ridden events. The inclusion of the obligatory murdered pet is just one example of how formulaic and unoriginal this film truly is.

While the cast delivers uniformly adequate performances, there's nothing remarkable about their acting. Jay Underwood's portrayal of the stalker veers into melodrama, while Maryam d'Abo's portrayal of Brooke lacks the strength and independence necessary for her character to be believable as a fledgling restaurateur.

The plot relies on absurd scenarios that strain the audience's suspension of disbelief and call into question the intelligence of the characters involved. The film's attempt at suspense falls flat, resulting in a tedious viewing experience that fails to deliver anything remotely engaging.

"Stalked" may not be as offensive as some other thrillers in its genre, but it offers little more than a rehash of tired tropes and worn-out clichés. With its derivative plot and lackluster execution, this film is best avoided by anyone seeking a genuinely suspenseful or original viewing experience.
