"Stalked" manages to carve out its own niche in the realm of thriller films by offering a slightly different take on the stalker genre. While it may follow some familiar tropes, the film's deviation from the typical narrative arc, where the stalker quickly faces rejection, adds an intriguing layer to the story.

The cast delivers solid performances, with Jay Underwood bringing just the right amount of creepiness to his role as the stalker, Daryl. Maryam d'Abo shines as Brooke, the object of Daryl's obsession, infusing her character with a sense of vulnerability that adds depth to the plot.

Despite its predictability, "Stalked" manages to maintain a level of suspense throughout, keeping viewers engaged until the inevitable showdown between stalker and stalked. The inclusion of murder scenes and brief nudity adds to the film's tension without feeling gratuitous.

Overall, "Stalked" may not reinvent the wheel, but it offers a decently crafted thriller that is worth a watch for fans of the genre. With its competent performances and enough twists to keep things interesting, it stands out as a passable addition to the lineup of psycho-thrillers from the era.
